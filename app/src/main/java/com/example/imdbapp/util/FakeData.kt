Cobb&#39;s rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible, inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea, but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Top rated movie #13 | Won 4 Oscars157 wins & 220 nominations total","directors":"Christopher

      "title": "A Hollywood rarity - an intelligent action film",
      "content": "Christopher Nolan is a director to be applauded. His films may be sometimes flawed – as in the case of this one – and often overrated, but at least he's a guy working in Hollywood who strives for originality. INCEPTION might well be his most original film yet, a cerebral thriller that requires audiences to use their brains for once, rather than going over the same old ground. It's not quite the masterpiece that some say it is, but it is an engaging, well-made, and exciting movie that pretty much demands repeat viewings.The first two thirds of the movie had me spellbound. The set-up is intense, throwing out wonderful ideas at the audience and not hanging around to see whether they're accepted. It's definitely a film where you have to pay attention to every second, although saying that I had no trouble following what was going on. As our characters enter dream state after dream state, I was drawn into this world with them. Nolan is at the top of his game and even his super-fast-edited action sequences don't disappoint, with riveting gun battles and a fine car chase thrown in, too. Star Leonardo DiCaprio's back story adds an emotional core to the movie that it would have otherwise been missing and I loved being caught up in the various outlandish shenanigans.Which is why the ending is a little bit disappointing – not a lot, but a little bit nonetheless. The whole setup with the snowbound fortress smacks of Bond, and has a seen-it-all before quality the film sidestepped for the most part. It's as if Nolan pushed himself to the edge with the concepts he introduced in his movie, and then stepped back, afraid. We needed more scenes like the bit with the train and the revolving corridor, and less conventional action. There's plenty of scope for truly mind-blowing stuff in the dream worlds he so painstakingly creates – like the awesome early scene with the folding city. But then he just delivers some sub-Bond antics and wastes what could have been a truly superb premise.I also had a slight problem with the ending, which goes on and on, with multiple scenes dragged out in a manner reminiscent of RETURN OF THE KING (although never quite as bad as that). Still, these are minor flaws in an otherwise very well made and entertaining movie. The ensemble cast are great: DiCaprio has matured nicely as a thinking man's hero, and the normally irritating Ellen Page is okay as the character whom the viewer follows into the antics. Michael Caine delivers a nice cameo, and Ken Watanabe reminds us all of what a fine actor he is. There are also good turns for up-and-coming stars like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, and Marion Cotillard, and a very nice performance from one of my favourites, Cillian Murphy. So, while it may not be the masterpiece that I was hoping for, INCEPTION is definitely a step in the right direction of intelligent Hollywood filmmaking."

Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is skilled at stealing secrets by diving into your dreams. It's a dark treacherous world where he has made too many enemies. Now he is offered a chance to come in from the cold. This time his team is tasked to plant an idea into the target's mind, or in one word inception.Christopher Nolan has created something of a Penrose-stairs structure in this movie. It's complicated and may be too convoluted to be reasonable. But that's as much part of its charm. The worlds, the effects, the ideas are all first rate. It is oozing with originality.The actors are also first rate. Nolan can command the best cast to his projects now. There is nobody better than DiCaprio to anchor this movie. Nothing about this movie is done with lesser parts. This is indeed a top movie."

      "content": "If one goes to an art gallery to see a provocative piece, one sees something new each time. That's what true art is. That's why a black light Elvis is not art. This film is certainly a tour de force. It requires engagement at every step. LIke most works of art, it doesn't give it all away. I look forward to seeing this the second or even third time. First of all, the premise is wonderfully engaging. Our consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have awakened, only to find themselves in another nightmare--then they awaken again. We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our control. There you have a wonderful premise. Now layer that further with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends. While confusing, it's exciting. The amazing thing is that the director/writer pulls it off. Every nuance and event is picked precisely for its effectiveness. We have the luxury of watching from one precipice into the abyss. We do care about the people and not just because we want them to succeed. We care about the matrix of the dream levels. Great movie."

      "title": "A deep dive into the human mind, Nolan at his finest",
      "content": "The word \"Inception\" will always be associated with this 2.5-hour movie we have here and that says it all basically about how defining the outcome is. But first things first: The writer and direcctor here is of course Christopher Nolan and his British/American production from 2010 is maybe still his defining effort ten years later. They are showing this in theaters now again for said tenth anniversary and I happily took the chance to give it another watch, my third in fact and it definitely was not worse than my first or second. This is the kind of film that is indeed a lot better to be seen on the big screen, not only, but also because of the special effects. This movie won four Oscars, so also a big success with awards bodies, especially because it took home 150 more awards and over 200 more nominations and that is just what is listed here on imdb. Still I remember many people outraged back then because the one thing it did not get was an Oscar nomination for Nolan himself as director despite getting in at pretty much every important precursor. However, now in 2020, he also has his director nod and for this film here he got the writing nomination at least and that is absolutely alright because I think that the writing is the film's best aspect probably. Utter genius involved here and even more impressive if it was Nolan all on his own apparently.No Oscar nominations for the cast here. I think the only one who was slightly considered was Marion Cotillard and I would have liked it. She was really good, but then again I am a fan of her anyway. But it wasn't meant to happen and that is perfectly fine. She has one trophy already anyway, also did back then, which maybe helped her also in terms of getting cast here. She is one of several cast members that have worked with Nolan on other occasions before or after this movie, even if I think her portrayal in the final Batman film did not receive such positive acclaim overall. Oh well, others would be Murphy, Hardy and of course Michael Caine, who only has very little screen time here, two scenes and his second scene only lasts for a few seconds, but the first is really nice when his character meets the protagonist. Then there's a few actors whose star has gone down a bit in the last 10 years since this movie was made. Murphy may fit the description too to some extent, but I mostly mean the younger folks like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page. And Pete Postlethwaite is already dead for a few years, a bit sad knowing that now with how we see his character here dying too. May he rest in peace. But speaking of JGL, his role here is a bit of an example why he would never make it big in Hollywood. His character so plays second fiddle to Leonardo DiCaprio that it was a bit embarrassing almost here and there and among the weaker components of the film. Take the very early part already how he is trying so hard to convince Watanabe's character, while Leo knows his value and is all smooth and cool. Or how JGL is the one being caught and used to put pressure on Cobb (Leo) and even gets a bullet in the head. Or how he falls from the chair, kicked by Hardy I think, to elaborate on another phenomenon how people wake up from dreams. Oh yes, Watanabe I mentioned. Him I liked and like in general as an actor. I wish his character could have had more screen time to be honest, but his injury got in the way, but as we were sliding down the spheres, he gets better again. Still a bit strange how he so effortlessly turns into good guy and part of the team while being the antagonist before that and also with no real knowledge on the subject accompanies the thieves in their crucial endeavor involving Murphy's character. He was not really needed though.Another character who becomes part of the gang is Ellen Page's. She had some good moments and some not so good moments. Definitely not on par with the one other significant female character here, namely Cotillard's, but overall she is alright. The conscience scene with the \"people\" looking at her with angry faces is among the most memorable of the entire film. How she pushes these huge mirrors in position to show us the concept of going deeper and deeper into the mind, layer by layer, was also really good. But the idea that she really joins the gang too is already difficult to believe, but her return and talk about utter creation make me almost forget about it. What I cannot forget, however, is her final idea to step down to the bottom layer where Watanabe's character is lost. They acted as if this layer was simply too tough to take and then minutes later they are like okay well no biggie, let's go there and fix everything. The real final antagonist, namely Hal (Cotillard), waiting there alone sure cannot justify their initial thoughts about that layer and its impact. As for Cotillard's character, of course the French music was a pretty telling inclusion again linked to her previous Oscar-winning movie for sure. Everybody who saw that one, must have made the connection. Anyway, speaking of Page's character again, kinda telling that she gets an implied romantic relationship with the kiss moment between her character and JGL's. That was one of the very few funny moments and that is fine. It was okay, but no need to stretch it or turn it into a romance movie. Nolan has many other, bigger strengths and I am glad he focused on these.Also in my showing, some people laughed at everything they got the chance to laugh at. It was pretty embarrassing. They knew nothing about movie quality. Anyway, Nolan's biggest strength here is the attention to detail. As good as the overall concept may be, the best thing is what he did with these small moments, such as the carpet having the wrong material and we realize it is just a dream within a dream. There are many other examples, such as everything involving Hardy's character too. He also brought in some comedy, like when he is that lady or when he guns down the enemy and tells JGL's character to think big. But the overall concept is just as good, the idea of how being killed in a dream makes you wake up, all the layers, or the idea how we do not remember the beginning of a dream (how did the two get there?) and a lot more. Nolan's script really oozes brilliance and creativity here and I would have been totally fine with it winning a fifth Oscar. Or even with the film winning Best Picture, which it admittedly never had a shot at. But the concept of dreaming and how little we and science know about it now in the 21st century is something that has fascinated me for a long time really, especially because I am a very heavy and intense dreamer myself. So exactly my cup of tea this movie and maybe people with little interest in the overall idea will like it less. Or maybe not, if we take a look at the really high rating here on imdb and this really high ranking up in the top250. Not undeserving. Nolan created a world of genius.At the same time, away from all the sci-fi, he also managed to create a touching story between Cobb and Hal. The scene when she jumps down from the roof is of course especially haunting, but also how we never see their children's faces in the dream because Cobb refuses to until he sees them in reality. And does so in the end. Happy end? Maybe. But to me it all felt so rushed with how he meets the old self of Watanabe's character (by the way the quote about how he simply bought the airline was another great comedic moment, maybe Nolan is not as bad as I thought and should finally make a 100% comedy movie), turns him into a young man again within seconds and they all wake up inside the plane and even Murphy's character makes his peace again with his old man. And finally Cobb can, thanks to the Asian's help, get back to America and see his kids and then we see the swirling totem. Hal's totem. Does that mean we are indeed in her dream still. It could be with Nolan poking fun at unrealistic (in the truest sense of the word) rushed endings and nothing we saw was reality. Was Hal right all along? That's the good thing here. There is no 100% right or wrong. No 100% true or false and even if you watch this film ten times, you will still find something new you have not come across before, something new that can help you develop new creative approaches to the film and the reality depicted therein. Also have you ever asked yourself if you are in a dream yourself because when you are dreaming, then you usually don't know, so who says it couldn't be one we are all in right now. Anyway, this should be almost enough now with the review. You hopefully understood how much I liked this film.Just a few more snippets of information: 2010 was an amazing year for DiCaprio because he also appeared in Scorsese's \"Shutter Island\", another brilliant movie about the distorted human mind. I just mentioned the idea of totems. That I like as well, also with the additional idea that you should not let anybody touch your totem and how Cobb puts Page's character to a bit of a test there. Oh yes, another really smart reference the 1:10 proportion. One hour of dreaming equals ten hours of action in our dreams, which is why reality got slower and slower the further they dove down and how they showed it to us with the car crashing down the cliff (another happy ending that they are all saved) in fragments of 10% of a second maybe with all that has been going on underneath in the meantime was another stroke of genius for sure. There is so much to like here, it is pretty unreal. I am generally not a huge action film fan, but the very action-packed sequence in the icy region was good too. What can I say? I just like snow. Even if they had preferred an island in the sun or so. Another comedic moment. Alright. I think I'll leave it at that, even if there are another dozen moments at least so full of wit and creativity (just like myself) that they deserve elaboration on, but I won't because you need to watch it yourself instead!"

He has a problem in that there is a price on his head. He is a wanted man. A Japanese business man wants Dicaprio to enter the mind of a competitor and place an idea in his head to break up his empire. In exchange Dicaprio (Dom Cobb) would be allowed to go home to his family. Cobb first gets an architect (Ellen Page) who can design a complex location, such as a dungeon master creating the stage. He then must assemble a team of people with different skills to navigate through the dream world.The beginning of the movie is a bit confusing as you don't know what is real and what is a dream. However this shortly clears up. Dom Cobb has a lot of issues concerning his past life and dreamworld which jeopardizes the mission. His dead wife keeps showing up to foil his plans and he just hasn't the heart to kill her. The dreamworld works like a narcotic. Once you go into it, reality becomes boring. This movie is more brilliant in its complexity and script than it is in entertainment, but it worked for me."

      "title": "\"...it's never just a dream, is it\"?",
      "content": "Unless you're willing to commit and remain fully engaged, it's best to put off watching this film until those conditions are met. That's because the picture moves across various levels and back again over the course of the story, and though it may seem confusing, you'll be OK if you keep in mind the premises offered by the inception team - DiCaprio, Levitt, Hardy, Page and Rao. I'm purposely leaving off Watanabe because he was by his own admission a 'tourist' and had a stake in the outcome.In a movie universe that's virtually impossible to crack with something original, this is the most creative picture I've seen in a long time. Like an intriguing time-travel story, this one grabs hold of the imagination and allows one to consider the possibilities of an alternate reality. The closer technology brings us to these cutting edge barriers of time, space and mind, the more fantastic becomes the possibility of turning virtual reality into the real thing.The movie's strongest feature is it's exposition. The characters both show and tell the viewer what to expect, quite unusual when it comes to the 'tell' part, because we usually rely on the development of the characters and the events they experience to bring us along for the ride. The concepts here are much more esoteric, especially when attempting to layer the events of the story in a 'dream within a dream' construct. For the most part, I think this was all done quite cleverly, but again, you have to pay attention.It would be tough to come up with the most interesting concept touched on by director Nolan, but the one that intrigued me the most was the idea of the dreamer having the ability to block an extraction. In Fischer's (Cillian Murphy) case, his training foresaw the need to 'militarize' his subconscious against attack, thereby creating 'projections' that in turn attacked the inception team. Another clever idea involved the zero gravity effects of participants in the Level Two dream during the Fischer inception. This is all done with such frenetic skill that it's sometimes tough to keep up with, although repeat viewings clear up what may have been missed the first time around. Another hint - use the captions on your DVD to capture all the dialog. The players tell you a lot of what you need to know to follow the story.I don't want to go too far out on a limb and tell you this is the greatest thing since sliced bread, because I know the film won't appeal to everyone. However enthusiasts of good science fiction will find a lot to like here, as it invites the viewer to expand one's consciousness and dream of the possibilities. Seriously folks, no one had to plant the idea, it just came out like that."

      "title": "Inception",
      "content": "From BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight), this to me and I'm sure millions of other people was a much anticipated summer blockbuster, and I wasn't going to miss it. Basically, Dominic 'Dom' Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a skilled thief who steals valuable secrets in dangerous extraction, he enters a person's subconscious in their dreams, when the mind is most vulnerable. He is troubled man however, haunted by the memory's of his past with wife Mallorie 'Mal' (Marion Cotillard) and their subconscious experiences, and he is dying to change his past via the dream state. Saito (Batman Begins' Ken Watanabe) is offering him the chance of redemption by carrying out one last job using the subconscious entry, an impossible mission called inception. This would involve entering the mind of Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy), who has gained control of the company his recently deceased father Maurice (Pete Postlethwaite) owned, and placing in his mind the idea to shut down this company. So Cobb assembles a crack team of experts in the field of dream extraction and knowledge of inception, including Arthur ((500) Days of Summer's Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Ariadne (Juno's Ellen Page), Eames (Tom Hardy) and Yusuf (Dileep Rao). To make sure the mission can succeed they plan to go into a dream lasting ten hours, the length of Fischer's regular plane journey, and they will be going through three layers of dream state, i.e. Dream within a dream within a dream. So the main dream is Fischer and his assistant Peter Browning (Platoon's Tom Berenger) caught as hostages, and Fischer is convinced Browning is keeping something about his father from him. Then the next dream is Fischer convinced by Cobb that someone is trying to get into his head for this big secret, and he agrees to go into a dream to find out what the big secret is. Of course the dream states collide with each other, so the main dream sees some car chases as distractions in the big maze, so gravity for example of the characters in sleep will come into play in the other dreams too. But also the big problem with Cobb being in the dream is that his thoughts are being projected into the dream as well, such as the appearance of his wife and kids, his wife even kills Fischer when they need him most, forcing Cobb to go into his own memory of dream. In the end, the big secret placed into Fischer's mind is that his father wanted him to go his own way and create another company, and Cobb manages to come out with Saito as themselves, and the past is changed for Cobb for the better. Also starring Sir Michael Caine as Miles and Witness's Lukas Haas as Nash. There is a thought hanging over you when you watch that you really have to concentrate, but at the same time it is quite easy to keep up with where you are. If you can keep up with it, like I did manage to, you are completely taken in by the great action sequences, the well chosen cast, the imaginative concept, and the brilliant special effects to make it all possible, a fantastic and cool science-fiction action thriller. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Art Direction, Best Music, Original Score for Hans Zimmer, and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects, Best Production Design, and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Film, the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score, and Best Screenplay. Leonardo DiCaprio was number 94 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!"

      "content": "Around 750, the renowned poet of the Tang dynasty, Li Po, is supposed to have asked, \"Last night I dreamed I was a butterfly. Today, am I a butterfly dreaming I am a man?\" Marcus Aurelius, the late Roman emperor and philosopher, wrote, \"Life is a dream, a little more coherent than most.\" Freud concluded that dreams were the fulfillment of unconscious wishes that had managed to sneak past the dozing censor. Aboriginal Australians believed in a real parallel universe called The Dream Time in which everything and everyone who ever existed, still existed, and anybody could enter this place during sleep.Modern psychology believes that dreams are nothing more than random cortical bombardment caused by a lot of activity in sub-cortical structures associated with the filing of memories, and the cortex goes into overdrive trying to make narrative sense of them. Sex dreams are pleasant enough except when the furry little animals show up, but statistics demonstrate that the majority of dreams are truly lousy, the kind we can easily live without. Don't you get tired of running in slow motion through a swamp while being chased by an ogre? Does all this sound like pointless rambling to you? Well, then you're not going to enjoy \"Inception\" because it meanders at lightning speed all over the place and lives by no rules that human beings have ever known.On the other hand, if you find these adventitious allusions in some way interesting, then you should see this dark and muddled movie. You get a bonus too, because in its style it closely resembles an action movie from the 1980s. Everything is happening all at once -- or maybe not all at once. Who cares? The point is that people get shot in the forehead and buildings comes toppling down for no reason and slow-motion explosions take place at irregular but short intervals.I'm getting pretty tired of seeing films that use some bewildering metaphysical scheme as an excuse to show off still more CGIs. I couldn't watch this thing through."

      "content": "Often when one is told that a film is amazing it is a disappointment even if it is a decent film; that isn't the case here though; for me this film really did live up to the hype! Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb, a man who goes into other people's dreams to steal their secrets. One day a man approaches him with a far more difficult proposition; he wants an idea planted in the mind of a business rival; an idea the man must think was his own. Cobb is initially less than keen to do the job but the man has promise that he can arrange for him to get home to his children; something he can't currently do because he is suspected of killing his wife. To do the job he must assemble a team and take his target into a dream designed my new recruit Ariadne. This is no ordinary dream though; it requires the team to enter a dream within a dream within a dream! It is complicated further by the facts that his dead wife haunts Cobb and that if any of them die in the dream they will be trapped in a limbo.Director Christopher Nolan ably demonstrates that a big blockbuster film doesn't need to be in 3D these days nor does it need to be devoid of complicated ideas to succeed. DiCaprio did a fine job as Cobb and it was nice to see the excellent Ellen Page playing somebody who wasn't still a schoolgirl! While this film was about ideas that doesn't mean it wasn't full of spectacular special effects; while many of them were clearly computer generated they looked real enough to enable the viewer to suspend their disbelief in a way that often isn't possible. The idea of dreams within dreams could have been very confusing but each dream was very different so the viewer doesn't forget which layer of the dream is which once the action begins. If you have being putting off watching this film because you have been put off by the hype don't worry and watch it now; it is great."

      "content": "Not all of us viewers are alike, in what we enjoy. Many like to see a movie once, maybe take a few calls or texts during its running time, and never feel like they miss anything. And, when it is over, they are happy with the experience. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that type of movie-watching.However, that type will not do well with \"Inception.\" This movie is more for those of us who like to watch every bit of every scene, hear every word of dialog, and try to piece together a fairly complex story. Some can watch 'Inception' through just once and get everything, and I applaud them for that. But I needed to see it maybe four times, over an almost two year period, to appreciate fully how good it is. Leonardo DiCaprio is in the lead role as Cobb, he has become an expert in \"extraction\", the surely illegal activity of going into dreams with others and in the process extract some secret or other information. A good use for such a talent is industrial and business espionage.But Cobb has a new client that approaches him for the opposite task, the insertion of an idea into the target's mind, and in this case make the subject think it was his own idea. That is the process they call \"Inception.\" The idea for the story and resultant film was an approximate 10-year process for the writer/director Nolan. Much of the details are derived from his own dream experiences, such as what may seem like a day or week in a dream might be just a fraction of a minute in real time, and a familiar sound or loss of equilibrium might bring you out of your dream. The client that hires Cobb is Ken Watanabe as Saito. The subject is Cillian Murphy as Robert Fischer, whose industrialist father is about to die, and if the company is not forced to break into smaller units they will monopolize their market. The task is to, through inception, convince Robert that breaking the now his company into smaller units is his idea. To do that is a very complex task, and requires meticulous planning and several levels of dreams. All does not go as planned, unexpected assassins tail them, and all this provides for the drama and action.Another layer of intrigue is added by Cobb's situation, where his wife had died some time before but he was blamed, and as a result he has not been able to travel back to his home and children in the USA. He still sees her, in dreams, often when he doesn't really want to, while she tries to convince him they are not really in a dream, but real.Cobb's team members include Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur, Ellen Page as Ariadne, Tom Hardy as Eames, and Dileep Rao as the chemist for the sedative drugs, Yusuf.His wife is Marion Cotillard as Mal.I like this movie a lot, there is so much in it that I see many 'new' things each time. I look forward to seeing it again several times, maybe 6 to 12 months between viewings. I have it on Blu-ray and the video and audio are just state-of-the-art. A real joy to watch this movie."
